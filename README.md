# Who is Dave?

I was born and raised in Massachusetts. My mother and father struggled with addiction, which made it difficult, if not impossible, to 
hold a job that paid well enough to support me and my younger sister. We relied on government assistence for as long as I can
remember. We were granted housing assistance through the "Section 8" program. While I'm thankful that it kept a roof over our heads,
it all but guaranteed that my sister and I were goint to be raised in some pretty challenging environments. That proved to be
a very real reality. 

We moved around the north shore of Massachusetts very frequently. By the time I was 6 years old, I had already lived in at least
5 different cities and towns around the state. Shortly before entering kindergarten, my mother moved my sister and I to our first
apartment in the city of Woburn. 

For better or worse, I've had to overcome a large amount of hardships and trauma throughout my life.
